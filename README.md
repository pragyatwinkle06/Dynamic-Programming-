# Dynamic-Programming


Dynamic Programming is the most powerful design technique for solving optimization problems.

Divide & Conquer algorithm partition the problem into disjoint subproblems solve the subproblems recursively and then combine their solution to solve the original problems.

Dynamic Programming is used when the subproblems are not independent, e.g. when they share the same subproblems. In this case, divide and conquer may do more work than necessary, because it solves the same sub problem multiple times.

Dynamic Programming solves each subproblems just once and stores the result in a table so that it can be repeatedly retrieved if needed again.

Dynamic Programming is a   Bottom-up approach- we solve all possible small problems and then combine to obtain solutions for bigger problems.

Dynamic Programming is a paradigm of algorithm design in which an optimization problem is solved by a combination of achieving sub-problem solutions and appearing to the "principle of optimality" .
